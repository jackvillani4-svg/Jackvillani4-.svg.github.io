        <h1>Writing</h1>
        
        <p><em>"Writing, to me, is simply thinking through my fingers." - Asimov</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>For learning:</strong> I now write about a wide range of topics on my public blog: <a href="#">quarter mile</a>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>For thinking:</strong> I previously wrote 1000s of essays in my old daily blog. I now anonymously publish ~1000 words per day. I am working towards ten million words.</p>
        
        <p><strong>For reflecting:</strong> I make an annual review. Here is <a href="#">2025</a>, <a href="#">2024</a>, <a href="#">2023</a>, <a href="#">2022</a>, <a href="#">2021</a>, <a href="#">2020</a>, <a href="#">2019</a>, <a href="#">2018</a>, <a href="#">2017</a>, and <a href="#">2016</a>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>For helping:</strong> I wrote many guides to personal finance that have helped people save/make lots of money.</p>
        
        <p><strong>For fun:</strong> I have a lot of <em>~crazy~</em> ideas. I keep a list here: <a href="#">free ideas</a>. I also collect <a href="#">facts</a>, <a href="#">quotes</a>, and <a href="#">questions</a>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>For entertainment:</strong> I have an idea for a movie. I think it could be very entertaining.</p>
        
        <p><strong>For others:</strong> I started a writing agency that has helped companies like Stripe, Meter, and 20+ others create long-form essays.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> I sometimes feel the urge to erase all of my writing. That's mainly because I now disagree with many of my previously held opinions. So please do us both a favor and accept my disclaimer.</p>
